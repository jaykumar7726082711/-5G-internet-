# 📡 The 5G System

## introduction 


The 5G System (5GS) introduces a service-based architecture that provides:
- **Separation of Control Plane and User Plane**
- **Independent scaling** for different use cases
- **Flexible deployment** for varied performance requirements
- Support for both **Mobile Broadband (eMBB)** and **Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC)**

---

## 🏗️ 5G Architecture

The system consists of two main parts:

- **5G RAN (Radio Access Network)**
  - gNodeB / Ng-eNB (base stations)
  - Provides wireless connectivity to User Equipment (UE)

- **5G Core Network**
  - Based on service-based architecture (SBA)
  - Supports flexibility, scalability, and network slicing

---

## ⚙️ Key Network Functions

- **AMF (Access and Mobility Function)**
  - Mobility management & registration

- **SMF (Session Management Function)**
  - Session management & control of user sessions

- **UPF (User Plane Function)**
  - Data forwarding, policy enforcement, mobility anchor

- **AUSF (Authentication Server Function)**
  - Security & authentication

- **UDM (Unified Data Management)**
  - Stores user subscription data

- **PCF (Policy Control Function)**
  - Session & non-session policies, charging rules

---

## 🔗 Reference Points

- **N1:** UE ↔ AMF  
- **N2:** RAN ↔ AMF  
- **N3:** RAN ↔ UPF  
- **N4:** SMF ↔ UPF  

---

## 📚 Summary

5G System (5GS) is designed to:
- Provide **enhanced performance** for broadband and IoT use cases  
- Enable **network slicing** for customized services  
- Offer **scalability and flexibility** in deployment
